			<p>`Game of Thrones: The Last Watch aired on March 26th and had fans in awe as they 
			realized the truth in one the biggest moments in the series finale. As Kit Harrington read ahead during the first read
			his breathe is taken as he realizes what he just read. Not only did he stab his out incestual partner, but Drogon, who
			was still out of breathe and at his low, thought his mother was killed because she sat on the pointy throne, so he burns it down.`</p>

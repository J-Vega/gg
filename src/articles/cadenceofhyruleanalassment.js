                You ever get frustrated over game-breaking bugs, or find an inifinite-gold glitch that reminds you this whole experience is just a game you play to
                forget about real life? 
                Well Cadence of Hyrule has all the disappointment you'll need, and the best part is, you'll have to spend exactly zero hours of gameplay! 
                This is the collaboration I never knew I needed. Turns out, the Switch knows this is the collab we don't deserve.
                This game was set to release on June 13th, and it is currently June 14th in Japan. Maybe there's some timezone they've been keeping secret from us.<br/>
                I mean you already spent 25 dollars on this game, be grateful that's all Nintendo convinced you to waste."</p>
